## Formulas Used

### Mortgage Calculation
The monthly payment is calculated using the standard mortgage formula:

```
M = P [ i(1 + i)^n ] / [ (1 + i)^n ‚Äì 1 ]
```

Where:
- M = Monthly payment
- P = Principal (loan amount - down payment)
- i = Monthly interest rate (annual rate / 12 / 100)
- n = Number of payments (years √ó 12)

### ROI Calculation
```
Monthly Revenue = Nightly Rate √ó (30 days √ó Occupancy Rate / 100)
Annual Revenue = Monthly Revenue √ó 12
Net Annual Income = Annual Revenue - (Monthly Expenses √ó 12)
Annual ROI = (Net Annual Income / Initial Investment) √ó 100
Payback Period = Initial Investment / Net Annual Income
```
